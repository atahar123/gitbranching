# Git branching

making branches, pushing them, and merging them

As well as conflicts

# Learn to make a branch
```
git checkout -b <dev-name-of-branch>
```

Naming convention is:
```
  dev-description-of-feature
```

# Flow
1) make a new branch
2) code has git add and git commit
3) push branch to origin

## Useful git commands:
- git checkout -b <branch>
- git checkout <branch> (to move within branches)
- git branches (to see branches)
